# DAS_denoising_using_MDLF
We are in the process of organizing the data sets and trained models and are ready to upload them to Github.
This work has been submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research (JGR): Solid Earth.
We propose a deep learning method, which only requires the synthetic data and a few real noise to train the designed network, can denoise DAS data sets from the FORGE and SAFOD projects.
This work can enhance earthquake detection using the STA/LTA method.
